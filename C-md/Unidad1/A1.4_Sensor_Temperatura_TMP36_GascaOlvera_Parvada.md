1. Use the following list of materials to prepare the activity

    | 1        | LM741 Amplifier                   |[carrod](https://www.carrod.mx/products/lm741-amplificador-operacional)|
    | 1        | 5Volts power supply               |[uelectronics](https://uelectronics.com/producto/fuente-de-alimentacion-5v-10a/)|

2. Based on the image, assemble the stage 1 electronic circuit using a simulator, placing the LM35 transistor in the indicated position.

3. Calculate, measure and record the requested values ​​for Vout1, under the 3 conditions required in the attached table.

| Number | Condition | Voltage Vout1 measured | Voltage at R1 measured | Indicated temperature |
| ------ | --------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1      | Minimum    |99.9mV|11mV|-40C|
| 2      | Medium     |939mV|11mV|43C|
| 3      | Maximum    |1.75V|11mV|125C|

4. Using the image of the TMP36 transistor corresponding to stage 1, connect the Vout1 terminal to the non-inverting terminal of the LM741, and assemble the circuit corresponding to stage 2.

</p>

5. **What value should R3 have in the Stage 2 circuit, to obtain Vout2 = 3.3 volts,** for the maximum temperature condition that the sensor is capable of detecting? As can be seen, the resistance R3 corresponds to a potentiometer, however, resistance arrangements can be made to achieve a fine adjustment. What do you think is the reason why you are requesting a **3.3 Volt setting**?
   
6. Once the R3 value has been adjusted, leave it like that and record the requested values ​​for Vout2, for the 3 required conditions in the attached table..

| Number | Condition        | Voltage at R2 measured | Voltage in Vout2 measured | Indicated temperature |
| ------ | ---------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1      | Minimum condition |100mV|396mV|-40C|
| 2      | Medium condition  |940mV|3.72V|43C|
| 3      | Maximum condition |1.16V|4.60V|125C|

7. Graph Vout1 and Vout2, for the three previous conditions, considering in "X" the temperature values ​​and for "Y" the voltage values, and place inside this section.

8. Conclusions
## :beetle: Nelly Quino
<p>TMP36 is a precise sensor, it is easy to generate an analog signal that is directly proportional to temperature.
Because it use the fact as temperature increases, the voltage across a diode increases at a known rate.
Due to that, we use it when want to receive an alert because the temperature has reached an minimum or maximum temperature depend on the necessity of the system we monitor.</p>

## :frog: José Guzmán
<p>
The TMP36 sensor is a sensor with a transistor-like package and also has 3 pins. The TMP36 sensor allows us to measure the temperature, in an operating range from -40 ° C to 150 ° C. This sensor is not particularly accurate, but usually for simple projects as it is very inexpensive and easy to connect.</p>


## :camera: Michelle Gasca
<p>When conducting this investigation and circuit assembly in Tinkercad, we observed that the TMP36 sensor is very easy to use, since it only needs to be connected to ground, with a voltage between 2.7 and 5.5 volts, to later read the output voltage and convert it to temperature</p>

## :coffee: Francisco Villarreal 
<p>The TMP36 is a useful temperature sensor when it comes to environmental controls and thermal protection in large or small machines, handling a temperature between -40C and 150C. Something interesting that we found of the TMP36 is that having the output voltage we can calculate the temperature at which, by ossing with this, functions can be programmed depending on the temperature to avoid equipment damage.
